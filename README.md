# Steven's Personal Website

This repository houses the code for my personal website, a project I've undertaken to showcase skills as part of an assignment for Flatiron School prep work. To expedite the development, I leveraged my prior knowledge of Bootstrap along with the skills acquired from the course material. The website comprises a simple three-page structure, completed within a few hours. Images were sourced from Unsplash and the color palette was inspired by [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/).
